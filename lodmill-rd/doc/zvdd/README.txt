In the file "mapping.textile" resides a statistic about the frequency of field-keys.
Some keys have only a small amount of different values - these are good candidates 
to use as "controlled vocabulary" (in the LOD context also known as "URIs"). The keys
in question have a corresponding file in the same directory, named after the key.
In these files resides all the possible different values. After a possibly necessary
normalisation, these values be used to map to URIs.
